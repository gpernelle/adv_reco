# Gaussian Processes

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for both regression and probabilistic classification. They are commonly
used in Machine Learning and can be applied to recommendation systems as well, although they are not as commonly used as
some other techniques, like collaborative filtering or matrix factorization.

The central idea behind using Gaussian Processes in a recommendation system is that they allow for a form of
collaborative filtering based on continuous (as opposed to discrete) values and can take into account uncertainty in the
data.

## Here's a simplified overview

### Data Modeling
GPs start by modeling your data as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, where the data points are
treated as random variables. For a recommendation system, each user-item interaction can be represented as a data point
in this Gaussian distribution.

### Kernel Functions
GPs use a kernel function to measure the similarity between data points. In the context of a
recommendation system, this might mean measuring how similar different user-item interactions are to each other. The
choice of kernel function can significantly impact the performance of the GP and it's typically selected based on the
problem at hand and the type of data you're dealing with.

### Predictions
Once you have your GP set up, you can make predictions by conditioning the Gaussian distribution on the
observed data. This will give you a new, posterior distribution that represents your updated beliefs after observing the
data. You can then use this posterior distribution to make predictions about unobserved user-item interactions, i.e.,
recommend items to users.

### Incorporating User Preferences
If you have information about user preferences, you could incorporate these into the GP as well. You would likely need to use a type of
kernel function that can take these preference variables into account.

One of the benefits of GPs is that they provide a measure of uncertainty along with their predictions. This means you
not only get a recommendation, but also a measure of how confident the system is in that recommendation.


### Computation requirements
It's important to note that Gaussian Processes can be computationally expensive, especially as the number of data
points (user-item interactions) increases. This is due to the need to invert a large covariance matrix, which is an
operation that scales cubically with the number of data points. There are methods to scale Gaussian Processes, such as
using inducing points or sparse methods, but they add additional complexity to the model.
